Even 1 hour forgotten = ‚Ç©1,500 wasted
```

**2. Do prep work on Windows:**
```

- Only use Mac for building/testing
```

**3. Batch your work:**
```
Instead of:

Do:
- 3 hours in one session (‚Ç©4,500)
- Save on startup/shutdown time

**4. Be organized:**
```
Before connecting:
- Know what you'll build
- Know what you'll test

## 📸 Connection Details - What to Look For

**Once server is running, you need:**

```
IP Address: 208.xxx.xxx.xxx (or similar)
Username: macuser (or similar)
Password: [random string like "Abc123XYZ"]
Port: 5900 (VNC) or 3389 (RDP)

These might be:
- Shown directly on the page
- Behind a "Show Details" or "Connection Info" button
- In a popup after clicking the server name
```

**SAVE THESE! You need them for Remote Desktop!**

## ⏱️ Timing Expectations

**If creating new server:**
```
Click "Create" → Wait 2-5 minutes → "Running" status
```

**If starting existing server:**
```
Click "Start" → Wait 2-5 minutes → "Running" status
```

**Be patient!** Server provisioning takes a few minutes.
